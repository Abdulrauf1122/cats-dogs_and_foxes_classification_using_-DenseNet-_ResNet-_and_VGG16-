# cats-dogs_and_foxes_classification_using_-DenseNet-_ResNet-_and_VGG16-
This project uses deep learning models (DenseNet, ResNet, VGG16) to classify images into three animal categories: Cats, Dogs, and Foxes. The models are pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned using transfer learning for this classification task. It uses Keras and TensorFlow for model development and evaluation.
